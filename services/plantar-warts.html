          <h2>Plantar Warts Q& A</h2>
          <div class="details">
            <h2>What are plantar warts?</h2>
            <p>
              Plantar warts are growths on the soles of your feet. This type of
              wart spreads quickly and often grows in clusters. Because you
              stand and walk on plantar warts, they can be quite painful. Having
              plantar warts may feel like you're continually walking with
              pebbles stuck in your shoe.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              Plantar warts often have small burst blood vessels that look like
              tiny black dots in the middle of the growth. They're generally
              much flatter than other warts because you push on them with your
              body weight every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's quite common to develop calluses, thick pads of rough skin,
              over plantar warts. The calluses push plantar warts deeper into
              your foot and intensify the pain.
            </p>
            <h2>Why do I have plantar warts?</h2>
            <p>
              Plantar warts occur because of human papillomavirus (HPV). Little
              cuts or scrapes on the sole of your feet could allow HPV to breach
              your skin and grow into a plantar wart. You are most likely to
              contract HPV in public showers, swimming pools, and gym locker
              rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also get plantar warts if your feet directly touch an
              affected person's feet. It's even possible to transfer plantar
              warts from one of your feet to the other through direct contact.
            </p>
            <h2>How can I get rid of plantar warts?</h2>
            <p>
              Plantar wart treatment at Foot and Ankle Institute of Colorado is
              easy and straightforward. The team can take a few different
              approaches, which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paring calluses</li>
              <li>Topical acid solution</li>
              <li>Surgical wart removal under local anesthesia</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Sometimes, you may need a combination treatment to remove your
              plantar warts permanently. Plantar warts can be quite persistent
              because the Human Papilloma Virus can linger in your body. It's
              crucial to complete all recommended treatment and take steps to
              avoid plantar wart recurrence.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              It's essential to wear shoes in public places after your
              treatments to prevent reinfection. Keep your feet clean and dry,
              and if you notice any new growths, visit the team for an exam as
              soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>

              Institute of Colorado office nearest you or use the online
